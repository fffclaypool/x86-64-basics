## What is x86-64 Architecture
x86-64 (also known as x64, x86_64, AMD64 and Intel 64) is a 64-bit version of the x86 instruction set, first released in 1999.
x86 is a family of instruction set architectures initially developed by Intel based on the Intel 8086 microprocessor and its 8088 variant.
The term "x86" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in "86", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors.
And of course, the term 64 derives from "64" bit.

The basic architecture of the x86-64 is described in [Volume 1 of the System Developerâ€™s Manual](https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/a4/60/253665-sdm-vol-1.pdf).
In Chapter 3, there is the following diagram.
